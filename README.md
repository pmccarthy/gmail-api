## Gmail API Wrapper Script
The purpose of this script is to retrieve various statistics from Gmail using the Gmail API: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/?hl=en

For now the only statistics being retrieved are the number of emails sent by a specific user on a particular day.

Sample command

`python gmail-query.py -s <user> -y 2015 -m 12 -d 01`

  
## Prerequisites
Before the script can be run, there is a requirement for a client_secret.json file to be present in the root of this repository. This file can be generated by following the tutorial from the Google Gmail API Docs: https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python
